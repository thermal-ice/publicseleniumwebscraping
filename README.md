# corporateSpeak
 Webscraper that collects corporate jargon and throws it onto google sheets. Run from main.py
 
 You ONLY NEED main.py, webscraping.py, and google_sheets.py as the python files. You also need a chrome driver for selenium, and creds.json to connect to google_sheets.
 
 Note: Chromedriver only works for MAC OS, and for chrome version 77. Replace it with the chromedriver that will work for your device.
